Good day all.  What will this blog be about.  I think it will be about a lot of things but primarily it will be a link blog.  Not sure where it will go from there
but I am sure I will get more and more into it.  My schedule is going to be once a week on Monday Morning at 10AM eastern. It will be a roll up of the previous week.  It will focus on technology but also other issues that I think are important for anyone reading.  It will be opinionated.  That means it will be my opinion, no one elses. Not a company or entity that I work for.  This will just be me.  Not sure if I will allow comments yet, but I will be thinking about it. I will figure out a feedback mechanism eventually but for now.  Let's see where this journey takes us!
